# Roadmap for Forking CryptoPunks to MazzePunks

This roadmap details the steps necessary to complete the fork of the CryptoPunks project to MazzePunks, adapting it to work on the Mazze BlockDAG instead of Ethereum.

## Overview

The forking process is divided into 5 main steps:

1. **Rename Contract Files**: Rename all contract files and update references.
2. **Update Contract Code**: Modify the code to reflect the necessary changes for MazzePunks.
3. **Create and Update Image Assets**: Create new image assets for the MazzePunks collection.
4. **Update Documentation**: Update all project documentation.
5. **Update Configuration**: Update project configuration files.

## Progress

| Step | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 1. Rename Contract Files | ⏳ In Progress | Some references already updated |
| 2. Update Contract Code | ⏳ In Progress | Name, symbol, and standard already updated |
| 3. Create and Update Image Assets | ⏳ Pending | |
| 4. Update Documentation | ⏳ In Progress | Basic README already updated |
| 5. Update Configuration | ⏳ Pending | |

## How to Use This Roadmap

Each step of the roadmap is in its own directory, containing two files:

- **goals.md**: Describes the objective of the step.
- **tasks.md**: Lists the specific tasks needed to achieve the objective, with progress status.

Use these files to track progress and ensure all necessary tasks are completed.

## Next Steps

1. Complete file renaming and reference updates
2. Finalize contract code updates
3. Begin creating image assets
4. Continue updating documentation
5. Update project configuration
