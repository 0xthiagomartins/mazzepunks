# Objective: Update Contract Code

The objective of this step is to modify the contract code to reflect the necessary changes for MazzePunks, including updating names, symbols, image hashes, and any other references to the original project. Additionally, it is important to adapt the contract to work with the Mazze BlockDAG instead of Ethereum, considering possible implementation differences.
