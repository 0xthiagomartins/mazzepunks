# Objective: Rename Contract Files

The objective of this step is to rename all contract files from the CryptoPunks project to reflect the new name MazzePunks, ensuring that all references to these files throughout the project are correctly updated. This is fundamental to establish the identity of the new project and avoid confusion with the original project.
